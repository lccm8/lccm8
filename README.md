<h3> Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ </h3> 

I'm Leonardo Colosimo, a passionate, creative and cross-functional finance professional based in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

All my quantitative work is done on R. I am an advanced developer in this language, with extensive knowledge in forecasting and simulation methods, as well as tools for system integration â€“ such as API interfaces, SQL database connection, web scrapping and reporting systems. 

Despite a diverse portfolio in data analysis, my focus is on finance-related projects. Here is a brief summary of my work:

- Price and volatility prediction tool for financial markets, as well as integration of forecasting with different trading strategies.
- Risk allocation tool for day trading, created to improve long-term profitability of investment strategies.
- Cryptocurrency bot, fully integrated with a major exchange and developed to automate order book management.
- Automation of P&L daily report through R markdown, web scrapping and Excel.
- Statistical arbitrage (cointegration) study for over 200K pairs of stocks available on Yahoo Finance API.
- Risk profile analysis of different traders and trading algorithms, along with hedging strategies adapted to each case.
